# Web Scraping JavaScript with Python

The code shows how to do web scraping dynamic content pages generated from Javascript using Python.

We use as data the Blockchain site to extract stats information and generate a text file.

The python script writes a log and every 60 seconds it will add a new line to the log file. It could be performed in a shorter term but that would be a high load.
